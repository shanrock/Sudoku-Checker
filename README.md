# Sudoku-Checker
This Sudoku checker will read in a csv file of a 9X9 Sudoku board and check to see if it's a valid board.
The valid board will consist of no duplicate numbers in a row, column, or the 3X3 square in which the number resides.
The valid board will only have numbers 1-9 in any give cell.
If the board is valid, the program will output a list of possible numbers for each empty cell to a csv file.

** The user should change the name of the csv file they wish to check in the string fileName in main. **

Future version will have a more interactive console window allowing the user to directly input the name of the file they wish to check.
